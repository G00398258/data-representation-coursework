Gillian is the lecturer for Data Representation.
Gillian is nice. He tells us to stand up and take a break after every video!
This week, Gillian asked us to write a program in python that will read a file from a repository. 
The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Gillian" with your name.
Gillian said the program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository.
Gillian does not need to see the keys.
